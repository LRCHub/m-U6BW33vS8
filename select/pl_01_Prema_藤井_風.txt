Prema
Don't u know that u are love itself
You are love itself
Prema
Can't u see that u are god itself
You are god itself
I don't lie
I'm all about the truth and
I don't hide
Overwhelmingly I'm open
I survived
All the crazy things you gave
n every mess that was ever made
You are mine
I call your name and you will
Be on time
Living in this small world and its
Future's bright
Brighter than my ceiling lights
n sweeter than my mother's cream pie
Follow my tender heart and I'll win
No matter what pain I am in
With all your blessings I'll arise
Open up my third eye
Prema
Don't u know that u are love itself
You are love itself
Prema
Can't u see that u are god itself
You are god itself
Finalized
We got each other always
Fantasized
Surely knew we could do it
I decide
Every day I meditate
And make every action a prayer
Filling my heart with your affection
Being your best friend is my devotion
Calling your name is my surrender
Babe, I got your number
Filling my heart with your affection
Being your best friend is my devotion
Calling your name is my surrender
Babe, I got your number
Prema
Don't u know that I am love itself
I am love itself
Prema
Can't u see that I am god itself
I am god itself
